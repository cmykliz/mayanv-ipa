# IPA transcribed Mayan language corpora (forked from ["MayanV"](https://github.com/transducens/mayanv))

Using the `epitran` module's transliterate function (see forked ["epitran-mayan"](https://github.com/cmykliz/epitran-mayan)) to re-transcribe the orthographical representations of mayan language words into the international phonetic alphabet (IPA), the entire MayanV corpora is presented here for phonological interest.
